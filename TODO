4) Create a PhysicsController class and begin simple dynamics simulation

RENDERING
1) Create the Material and Texture classes
2) Create a threaded Texture loader, which creates an additional OpenGL context for loading textures into GPU memory
3) Create an AnimationController and begin doing animated PNG loading and playing
