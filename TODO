3) Create a PhysicsController class and begin simple dynamics simulation

RENDERING
1) Reexamine / rework the relationship between materials and textures
2) Create a Font class, which has a font texture, produces renderables, etc
3) Create a threaded Texture loader, which creates an additional OpenGL context for loading textures into GPU memory
4) Create an AnimationController and begin doing animated PNG loading and playing

CONTENT
1) Create a ThreadedFontFactory
2) Create a Property List loader, which can read generic property lists and update resources with them
